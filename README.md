# 🚀 Java Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Java Programs Repository**! 🎉  
This repository documents my step-by-step **learning journey of Java programming** — starting completely from scratch and gradually moving through each concept with practical examples and programs.  

## 📌 About This Repo  
- I started learning **Java from the basics**.  
- Each program reflects a concept I learned (variables, loops, OOP, exceptions, etc.).  
- The repo is a collection of small programs that **showcase my progress** and understanding of Java.  
- The main goal is to **learn by coding** and create a reference for future use.  

## 🧑‍💻 Topics Covered (so far)  
- Basics of Java (syntax, variables, operators)  
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)  
- Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Methods and Functions  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)  
- Exception Handling  
- And more as I continue learning 🚀  


## 🎯 Goal  
- To **master Java step by step** by writing programs.  
- To keep track of my **progress and learning path**.  
- To create a resource that might **help beginners** who are also starting with Java.
